# SPI_Interface
Design a FPGA based SPI interface works in slave mode 
The motivation for this design is a lot of times FPGA needs to interface with an external processor. There are some configurable value in FPGA to configure some behavior which is called "register"
This design creates slave SPI interface for external processor to configure FPGA registers
This project can't be implemented due to non IO assignment. This is for logic synthesis only.
